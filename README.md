Necessary Deliverable for AJAX Flickr Lab:
---

* Support infinite scroll to show all results from Flickr (eventually, after a lot of scrolling).
* Prevent your code from making too many requests: only one at a time, please
* Don't request more images when you reach the last "page" of Flickr results
* Make sure you go back to the first page when searching for a new term!
* Make it beautiful
* Add other features as you see fit
* Bonus: display larger images in an attractive slideshow
* Bonus: add links back to each image's own page on Flickr.com
